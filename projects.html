            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                The purpose of this project is to examine patterns of conflict events involving Israel and Palestine from 1946 to
                2021.
                Our analysis uses the Uppsala Conflict Data Program (UCDP) dataset, downloaded from Kaggle:
                <a
                    href="https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zazaucd/conflict-data">https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/zazaucd/conflict-data</a>
                This dataset contains event-level records of organized violence, including the actors involved, conflict type,
                location,
                and date. Because the dataset covers many global conflicts, our task was to identify, clean, and analyze the
                specific
                subset related to Israel and Palestine.
                Our group posed several guiding research questions, including:
            </p>

            <h3>Methods & Results</h3>
            <p>
                I began by examining the dataset's structure using .info() and .describe() to understand the variables,
                completeness,
                and data quality. I discovered that many columns were missing large proportions of values, so I filtered out columns
                with over 80% missing data. This produced a cleaner, more workable dataset.
                Next, I selected a set of useful columns relevant to the questions I was addressing (such as location, side_a,
                side_b,
                year, and type_of_conflict). I copied these selected columns into a separate dataframe to simplify processing.
                I then converted start_date and ep_end_date to datetime formats using pd.to_datetime, and normalized the text in
                side_a,
                side_b, and location so that name variations could be matched consistently. I created keyword lists to identify
                events
                involving Israel or Palestine. Using these keywords, I filtered the dataset into a subset (df_ip) containing only
                events
                in which either side_a or side_b matched those groups.
                To ensure accurate categorization, I wrote a helper function contains_keyword(text, keywords) to detect group
                references
                in each row. Using this, I created new columns identifying whether each row involved Israel, Palestine, or both.
                From
                there, I generated basic frequency counts and visualizations showing conflict types over time.
            </p>
            <h3>Conclusions & Limitations</h3>
            <p>
                Our analysis reveals several important patterns:
                1.Conflict types vary substantially over time.The animated bar chart shows clear shifts in dominant conflict types
                in different periods. Certain decades are marked by
                increases in organized battles, while others show rises in one-sided violence(civilian targeting).
                2. Events involving Israel and Palestinian groups occur across the entire historical range of the dataset.
                The line chart confirms that conflict events are not limited to a single era, but instead persist from 1946 through
                2021.
                3. The dataset supports broad comparisons between actors.
                By isolating Israel-related and Palestine-related events, we can distinguish which groups appear most often in
                different
                roles and conflict types, although precise attribution requires caution.
            <h3>Limitations</h3>
            1. Lack of geographic precision:
            The dataset does not provide latitude/longitude, limiting our ability to identify specific cities or create accurate
            geographic heatmaps.
            2. Missing data:
            Many original columns were unusable due to extreme missingness, requiring extensive filtering.
            3. Ambiguous actor names:
            Variations in actor naming (e.g., “Government of Israel” vs. “Israel Defense Forces”) required manual keyword matching,
            introducing potential error.
            4. Event duplication within years:
            Because we used the uncollapsed dataset, some years contain multiple records that may refer to related incidents
